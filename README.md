# Docker for [Pocketbase](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase)

!! Work in progress !!

A simple script to build a docker image for pocketbase and apply it. At the moment it is downloaded from the release page and no checks are made on signatures etc.
Later on a signature check and an option to build it will be added
